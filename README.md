### Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shuklaAlkesh/Clone-google-Sheet.git
    cd Clone-google-Sheet
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install

### Running the Application

The application consists of both a backend server and a frontend client. To run both:

1.  **Development mode (runs both client and server):**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start:

    *   Frontend development server with hot reloading (typically on port 3000)
    *   Backend server (typically on port 5000)

### PostgreSQL Database Configuration

The application uses a PostgreSQL database to store spreadsheet data. You will need to configure the database connection details in the `.env` file.

```

```

Replace the placeholders with your actual PostgreSQL database credentials.
